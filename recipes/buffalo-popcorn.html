    <p>A different kind of popcorn!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 cups popped popcorn</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Fill with popcorn.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet 
        with parchment paper or a silicone pad.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
        Cook, without stirring and swirling pan gently as needed, until sugar has melted 
        and the caramel is a deep amber color, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Stir Buffalo sauce and butter carefully into the caramel; it will spit and bubble 
        and may form a ball. Return to heat; bring to a boil, stirring until caramel is 
        dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda and cayenne 
        pepper.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Pour spicy caramel mixture carefully over the popcorn. Toss to completely coat, guarding 
        your hands from the hot caramel. Spread the coated popcorn onto the prepared baking sheet.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes; stir.</p>
